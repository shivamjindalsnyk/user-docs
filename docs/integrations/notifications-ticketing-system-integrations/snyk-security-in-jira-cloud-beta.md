{% hint style="info" %}
R\&D engineering managers who own Jira projects and know their team's code repositories can handle this task.
{% endhint %}

1. In Jira, go to **Project settings** > **Toolchain** and find Snyk in the list of tools (see [What is the project toolchain in Jira Software?](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/what-is-the-project-toolchain-in-jira/)).

3. Choose the container (code repository) from the list and select **Add container**.

Developers can now use the security feature to view recent vulnerabilities found in the linked code repositories and start [creating Jira issues](snyk-security-in-jira-cloud-beta.md#create-a-jira-issue-out-of-a-vulnerability) from them or [linking them to existing Jira issues](snyk-security-in-jira-cloud-beta.md#link-an-existing-jira-issue-to-a-vulnerability).

## Manage security vulnerabilities in Jira

After the app installation, you can view vulnerabilities in the security tab on the Jira project page.

To find vulnerabilities, go to the **Vulnerabilities** section. Snyk shows the severity, status, and identifiers. Click the title to get the details in Snyk Web UI.

### Search, filter and sort vulnerabilities

Use the search bar and filters in the **Vulnerabilities** section to customize the list of vulnerabilities to those relevant to your organization.

Ignored and closed vulnerabilities are not shown in the **Vulnerabilities** section by default, but you can view them using the **Vuln. status filter**.

Select the title of a column in the table to sort all vulnerabilities by that attribute.

### Create a Jira issue from a vulnerability&#x20;

When triaging issues, you can add a Jira issue to the sprint or backlog to ensure the required work for resolving the vulnerability is planned and tracked.

Snyk provides vulnerability information to Jira, enabling users to have comprehensive data for resolving issues.

To add a Jira issue, go to the Snyk Security tab, find a vulnerability, and then click **Create issue**.

### Link an existing Jira issue to a vulnerability

If the vulnerability already has a Jira issue, you can link the existing Jira issue by clicking the horizontal ellipsis icon and selecting **Link issue.**
